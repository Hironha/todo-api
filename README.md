# TODO-API

## Introduction

This repository contains basic implementation of a REST API to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) **Todo** items in many languages following clean architecture guidelines. It is not recommended to use the code from this repository as a reference to clean architecture, since it's a really basic application that does not benefit from clean architecture at all, in fact, it's worse using it for this kind of application, due to many layers of abstraction.
